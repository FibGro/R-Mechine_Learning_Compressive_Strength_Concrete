# Concrete

This study's objective is to predict concrete compression strength based on several mixture properties. 
In this study, we will implement several machine learning models, such as Multiple Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Extreme Gradient Boost (XGBoost). 
Then, we will choose the optimal model based on the MAE and R-squared values from the predictions of the test dataset.
